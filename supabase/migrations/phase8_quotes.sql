-- Quote tab: trade-in/buylist quoting for customers selling cards TO the
-- shop (the reverse of Catalog/Scanner/Import, which are about the shop's
-- own outbound stock). Ported from a manual Excel sheet the shop already
-- used — see CLAUDE.md's "Quote tab" section for the full design.
--
-- One `quotes` row is both a "collection" (an in-progress staging area
-- staff build up, e.g. "Jake binder proposal") and, once its offer_status
-- is set, the finalized record of that transaction — there is no separate
-- collection entity. Line items live in a single `items` jsonb array
-- rather than a child table: they're never queried independently of their
-- parent quote, matching this app's existing preference for denormalized
-- snapshots over relational child tables (e.g. sync_queue tickets already
-- snapshot fields rather than joining back to catalog). Each item:
--   { id, name, game, set, number, rarity, printing, condition,
--     basePrice, price, qty, notes }
-- Condition is deliberately never defaulted client-side (a genuine
-- physical assessment staff make at the counter), so it can be blank.
--
-- offer_status is one of: null (still open/in-progress), 'accepted_cash',
-- 'accepted_store_credit', 'rejected'. converted_to_catalog guards against
-- creating duplicate Catalog rows if an already-accepted quote is edited
-- and saved again — the accept-time conversion only fires once, on the
-- transition into an accepted state while this flag is false.
--
-- quote_number is a human-friendly display id ("Quote #14") — the uuid
-- primary key isn't something staff should ever need to read or type.
--
-- Deliberately NOT added to catalog_public_view (quotes are a staff-only
-- concern, never shown on the public binder page) or to sync_queue
-- (unrelated concern — sync_queue tracks the shop's own outbound listings
-- across POS/TCG Player/Collectr, not buy-side transactions).
--
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL Editor before deploying this code. After
-- running it, also add `quotes` to the `supabase_realtime` publication via
-- the Supabase dashboard (Database → Replication) — that step isn't done
-- by any migration file in this repo (catalog/sync_queue needed the same
-- one-time manual step when they were first set up).
