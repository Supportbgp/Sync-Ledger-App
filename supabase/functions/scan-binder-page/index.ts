Only fall back to the era name if the specific expansion truly isn't legible. For One Piece specifically, an expansion NAME is rarely printed on the card itself — report the set-code prefix instead, from the same bottom-right code the number field reads (e.g. 'OP01' from 'OP01-001', or 'ST01' from a starter-deck card 'ST01-001') — this is what actually narrows a search for this game, same role a full expansion name plays for the others. For Lorcana, no expansion name is printed on the card at all — only a bare SET NUMBER (e.g. '6' for Azurite Sea), printed in the small bottom-left text next to the collector number. Report that number as the set value.

This is one of the strongest signals for telling apart same-name prints (a card can have many alternate-art/rarity versions with the same name, and — for a serialized card specifically — even physically distinct one-of-one copies), so look closely for it even if you're unsure of the set or rarity. LOCATION VARIES BY GAME: for Pokemon, it's typically near the set symbol at the bottom of the card, e.g. '280' or '280/217' if a total-count denominator is shown. For Magic, it's NOT near the set symbol (which sits on the type line instead) — it's in the small text along the bottom-left corner of the card, usually alongside a one-letter rarity code and a language code, e.g. a card printed '0744 LTR • EN' has collector number '0744' (keep any leading zeros exactly as printed). For Yu-Gi-Oh, it's the full printed set code in the bottom-left corner, e.g. 'LOB-005' or 'SDY-006' — report it exactly as printed, including the letters and hyphen (this is a global unique key across every Yu-Gi-Oh set, not just a bare number). For One Piece, the card's full code (set letters + number, e.g. 'OP01-001' or 'ST01-001') is printed together in the BOTTOM-RIGHT corner, right next to the rarity letter code (e.g. 'OP01-121 SEC') — report just the number portion after the dash (e.g. '001', '121'), not the set-code prefix (that belongs in the set field below). For Lorcana, it's in the small bottom-left text alongside the set number and language code, in the same 'this card / total in set' format as Pokemon, e.g. '154/204' — report it exactly as shown, denominator included if present. For Riftbound, it's at the bottom of the card as a set-code-plus-number combo followed by a total, e.g. 'OGN-310/298' — report just the number portion (e.g. '310'), not the set-code prefix (that belongs in the set field above) or the total.

const PROMPT_TEXT = "This is a photo of one page of a trading card binder — clear plastic " +
  "pockets, each holding one card. Identify every card you can see. For each, give its name " +
  "as printed, the game it's from, the set/expansion if you can tell, its printed collector " +
  "number if legible, its rarity if you can tell from printed text or a rarity symbol, " +
  "whether it looks foil/holo, its rough grid position, and how confident you are. A single " +
  "card name can have many different prints (alternate arts, different rarities, and — for a " +
  "serialized card — even physically distinct one-of-one copies) that only the set, number, " +
  "and rarity actually tell apart, so look closely for those even when you're confident about " +
  "the name. The collector number's location on the card varies by game: Pokemon prints it " +
  "near the set symbol at the bottom; Magic prints it in the small bottom-left corner text " +
  "instead, alongside a rarity letter and language code (e.g. '0744 LTR • EN' means collector " +
  "number '0744' — keep leading zeros exactly as printed); Yu-Gi-Oh prints a full set code there " +
  "instead of a bare number (e.g. 'LOB-005') — report it exactly as printed, letters and hyphen " +
  "included; One Piece prints its full code (set letters + number, e.g. 'OP01-001') together in the " +
  "bottom-right corner, right next to the rarity letter — report only the number portion after the " +
  "dash (e.g. '001') as the number, and the set-letters portion (e.g. 'OP01') as the set; Lorcana prints " +
  "it in the same bottom-left area in the same number/total-in-set format Pokemon uses (e.g. '154/204') — " +
  "report it exactly as shown; Riftbound prints a set-code-plus-number-plus-total combo at the bottom " +
  "(e.g. 'OGN-310/298') — report just the middle number ('310') as the number, and the set-letters " +
  "prefix ('OGN') as the set. For set, prefer the specific expansion name over the " +
  "general era/block if it's legible near the set symbol — for Pokemon cards, 'Scarlet & " +
  "Violet' alone is too vague when a more specific expansion name (e.g. 'Paldean Fates') can " +
  "be read; One Piece rarely prints an expansion name at all, so use its set-code prefix instead (see " +
  "above); Lorcana never prints an expansion name either, only a bare set number in that same bottom-left " +
  "text — report that number as the set; Riftbound likewise never prints an expansion name, only the " +
  "short set-letters code described above. For rarity on a Magic card, read the small expansion symbol's COLOR on the type line " +
  "(right edge, just above the rules text): black/white is 'Common' (also basic lands, which have " +
  "no symbol), silver is 'Uncommon', gold is 'Rare', red-orange is 'Mythic Rare', purple is " +
  "'Special' (Time Spiral timeshifted cards only), and a glowing/prismatic mythic symbol is 'Bonus' " +
  "(bonus-sheet cards like Vintage Masters' Power Nine) — leave it blank if the color truly isn't " +
  "legible rather than guessing from how good or powerful the card looks. For rarity on a " +
  "Yu-Gi-Oh card, judge from WHERE the foil/holo treatment sits, not overall art style: no foil " +
  "anywhere is 'Common'; foil on the name only (flat art) is 'Rare'; foil on the art only (flat " +
  "name) is 'Super Rare'; foil on BOTH name and art is 'Ultra Rare'; the same plus a raised, " +
  "embossed 3D texture is 'Ultimate Rare'; a diagonal rainbow holographic pattern over the name is " +
  "'Secret Rare'; a solid gold-colored name is 'Gold Rare'; a pale, washed-out, near-translucent " +
  "holographic art look is 'Ghost Rare'. Only report 'Platinum Secret Rare', 'Prismatic Secret " +
  "Rare', \"Collector's Rare\", 'Starlight Rare', or 'Quarter Century Secret Rare' if the entire " +
  "card front (border included) is unmistakably rainbow/holographic — these look similar to each " +
  "other and to plain Secret Rare in a photo, so leave rarity blank rather than guess between them " +
  "if you're not confident. For rarity on a Pokemon " +
  "card, judge PRIMARILY from the card's overall visual style, matching one of " +
  "Pokemon's real rarity names exactly (not a description) — how much of the card front is " +
  "illustration vs. a normal colored border/text box, whether the border itself is a foil/metallic " +
  "finish, and whether the Pokemon's name has an 'ex'/'EX'/'GX'/'V' suffix — rather than trying to " +
  "read tiny printed rarity text, which is often illegible from an ordinary binder photo even when " +
  "the card itself is clearly identifiable. Modern cards (2023+, lowercase 'ex'): full-bleed " +
  "edge-to-edge art with a holo border line is 'Illustration Rare' (non-ex) or 'Ultra Rare' (ex); " +
  "the same full-bleed art plus extra glitter foil is 'Special Illustration Rare'; a normal small " +
  "boxed-art frame with all-over foil for an ex Pokemon is 'Double Rare'; an all-gold border/" +
  "background is 'Hyper Rare' ('Mega Hyper Rare' instead if the Pokemon is a 'Mega ___ ex'). For " +
  "any 'Mega ___ ex' Pokemon (2025+ Mega Evolution era), check first whether the attack name itself " +
  "is printed in Japanese katakana instead of English — if so it's a 'Mega Attack Rare' regardless " +
  "of how full-art the rest of the card looks. Older cards (2012-2022, uppercase '-EX'/'-GX'/'V'): a normal frame " +
  "with the art breaking past its border, foil, for an EX/GX/V Pokemon is 'Rare Holo EX'/'Rare Holo " +
  "GX'/'Rare Holo V'; a non-EX/GX/V card with foil over just the art is 'Rare Holo'; full art with a " +
  "text bar remaining is 'Rare Ultra'; the same full art plus a gold border (or a collector number " +
  "past the set's total) is 'Rare Secret'. CAUTION: 'Ultra Rare' and 'Rare Ultra' are the same two " +
  "words in opposite order for two different eras — re-check which word comes first before answering " +
  "either one. Only fall back to reading a tiny rarity symbol/text for " +
  "the plain Common/Uncommon/Rare tiers, and leave rarity blank rather than guess if that's not " +
  "legible. The 'ex'/'EX'/'GX'/'V'/'VMAX'/'VSTAR' suffix itself is a card subtype, not a rarity, and " +
  "must never be reported as the rarity value — it's only a clue for picking the right rarity name " +
  "above. For rarity on a One Piece card, don't guess from visual style — read the short letter code " +
  "printed right next to the collector number in the bottom-right corner (e.g. 'OP01-121 SEC') and map " +
  "it exactly: C=Common, UC=Uncommon, R=Rare, SR=Super Rare, SEC=Secret Rare, L=Leader, SP=Special " +
  "Rare, TR=Treasure Rare, MR=Manga Rare (report 'Manga Rare', not plain 'Secret Rare', if the code or " +
  "an Oda-manga-panel art style tells you it's specifically that one). A small star above that code " +
  "means this print is also a parallel/alternate-art version, but doesn't change which rarity value " +
  "to report. Leave it blank if the code isn't legible rather than guessing from the art. For rarity on " +
  "a Lorcana card, read the SHAPE of the small symbol printed next to the collector number: a plain " +
  "filled circle is 'Common'; a book icon is 'Uncommon'; a triangle is 'Rare'; a diamond is 'Super " +
  "Rare'; a pentagon is 'Legendary'; a six-sided/hexagon shape with an unmistakable rainbow or " +
  "holographic finish across the whole card is 'Enchanted' (the rarest tier — looks distinctly " +
  "different from the others, never just plain foil). If the card is from an unnumbered promotional " +
  "release rather than a normal numbered set, report 'Promo' instead regardless of the shape shown. " +
  "For rarity on a Star Wars: Unlimited (SWU) card, read the gemstone/star symbol near the collector " +
  "number: grey/clear gemstone is 'Common'; green gemstone is 'Uncommon'; blue gemstone is 'Rare'; a " +
  "gold/yellow STAR (not a gemstone) is 'Legendary'. A premium foil/art treatment (Hyperspace, " +
  "Showcase, Prestige) doesn't change this value — it's a separate layered treatment, not a rarity. " +
  "Leave it blank for a card that doesn't clearly match one of those four looks (e.g. a suspected " +
  "'Special'-rarity card) rather than guessing, since that fifth tier has no confirmed visual marker. " +
  "For rarity on a Riftbound card, read BOTH the frame style and the small gem-shaped symbol next to " +
  "the collector number: plain bronze frame with a round gem is 'Common'; silver frame with a " +
  "triangular gem is 'Uncommon'; gold full-art frame with foil and a square gem is 'Rare'; a more " +
  "minimal gold frame with foil and a pentagonal gem is 'Epic'; no colored frame at all (a full-bleed " +
  "foil card) is 'Showcase', the chase rarity above Epic — a Showcase card that's also a special " +
  "Alternate Art/Overnumbered/Signature print is still just 'Showcase' for this field, not a different " +
  "value. An unnumbered promotional card is 'Promo' regardless of frame style. Leave it blank rather " +
  "than guess if the frame/gem isn't legible. " +
  "For every " +
  "other game, leave rarity blank unless an exact tier name is legibly printed on " +
  "the card itself — the visual-style guessing above is only verified for Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, " +
  "Lorcana, SWU, and Riftbound (One Piece instead reads an exact printed code, not a visual guess). " +
  "If you can't confidently identify a specific card, " +
  "still report it with your best guess and confidence \"low\" rather than skipping it. Do " +
  "not guess condition or price — only identification. Also give " +
  "a bounding box around just that one card's pocket (not the whole page), as fractions of " +
  "the full photo's width/height — this is used to crop that exact card out of the page " +
  "photo, so it needs to actually bound that card and not a neighboring one. Anchor on the " +
  "pocket's bottom edge first, since it's usually the clearest line on the page, then find " +
  "the top edge — that one's more often underestimated because it blends into the pocket " +
  "above. When uncertain, err toward a slightly larger box rather than a tight one: a little " +
  "extra background in the crop is fine, clipping part of the card is not.";
