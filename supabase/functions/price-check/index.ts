// tracking & spike alerts" section. Triggered on a schedule by
// .github/workflows/price-check.yml (GitHub Actions cron), never by the
// browser — unlike scan-binder-page/card-lookup-proxy, this has no CORS
// allowlist at all, since a browser is never the caller.
//
// Unlike every other Edge Function in this repo, this one reads/writes
// Postgres directly (catalog, price_history, price_alerts,
// price_tracking_settings) using the service-role client Supabase injects
// into every Edge Function automatically (SUPABASE_URL/
// SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY env vars — no `supabase secrets set` needed for
// those two). The HTTP call itself still needs a valid Authorization bearer
// to pass Supabase's default per-function JWT check — the calling GitHub
// Actions workflow authenticates with the same service-role key, stored as
// a GitHub repository secret (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY). See CLAUDE.md for
// the exact setup steps.
//
// Deploy from the repo root with:
//   supabase functions deploy price-check

// Per-provider price lookups below are a deliberately simpler, single-shot
// version of cardSearch.js's own interactive multi-tier fallback ladders —
// this runs unattended against the whole tracked catalog on a schedule, so
// request budget across many items matters more than getting any one item
// exactly right on the first try the way an interactive staff search does.
// A wrong/no match for one item just means no price_history row for it
// today, not a blocking failure — it'll be tried again on the next
// scheduled run. Field names/endpoints below mirror cardSearch.js's own
// already-confirmed shapes exactly (same real APIs, same response fields),
// not re-guessed from scratch.

// A real run's sampleFailures (see the Deno.serve handler's own diagnostics)
// showed the dominant cause wasn't retries or API flakiness at all — it was
// that catalog.name frequently has extra text typed straight into it that
// isn't part of a card's actual indexed name: a collector number ("Charizard
// 4/102", "Snorlax - 051", "Vaporeon ex - 149/131"), a rarity/variant note
// ("Dialga EX (122 Secret Rare)", "Pongo - Determined Father (Enchanted)"),
// or several of these stacked ("Vampiric Tutor (JP Alternate Art) (Silver
// Scroll Foil)"). None of this is surprising once named — catalog.number was
// never a real column (see the Deno.serve handler's own comment on that),
// so staff had nowhere else to put a collector number but Name itself. Two
// real, separate problems this one cleanup step fixes: (1) an exact/
// near-exact name search on pokemontcg.io/Scryfall/etc. simply won't match a
// real card's name against this extra text, which is "no_match", not a
// retry-able failure; (2) Scryfall's own query syntax treats literal
// parentheses as search-grouping syntax, not text, so a parenthetical-heavy
// name can come back as a request failure rather than a real search
// attempt — plausibly explaining Magic's own disproportionate share of
// "fetch_failed" results, all of which were parenthetical-heavy names in
// the same real sample.
//
// Deliberately does NOT strip a bare " - <Words>" suffix with no trailing
// number — several real official card names use exactly that format (SWU's
// "Cad Bane - He Who Needs No Introduction", Lorcana's "Pongo - Determined
// Father" once its own "(Enchanted)" suffix is removed). See
// dashFallbackNames below for how those are handled instead — as a second,
// narrower fallback tier, not by stripping the dash outright.
//
// A follow-up real run (checked climbed from 58 to 133 once this function
// existed, but still had real failures) showed two more real gaps:
// (1) a bracketed annotation ("Misty's Psyduck [W Stamped]") survived
// untouched — this only ever stripped parenthetical groups, never
// square-bracket ones; (2) a *mid-string* parenthetical group
// ("Sheoldred, the Apocalypse (Textured Foil) - Dominaria United (DMU)")
// survived too, because the original regex only matched a run of groups
// anchored to the very end of the string — the non-paren " - Dominaria
// United" text between the two groups broke that anchor, leaving
// "(Textured Foil)" in place to trip Scryfall's own literal-parens-as-
// grouping-syntax problem again (a "fetch_failed", not a clean no-match).
// Every parenthetical/bracketed group seen across every real sample
// collected in this whole debugging arc has been an extraneous staff
// annotation (rarity/variant/printing note, grading stamp, set code) —
// never part of a card's actual name — so stripping every such group
// anywhere in the string, not just a trailing run of them, is a safe
// generalization of the same already-verified assumption, not a new guess.
