// collector numbers (each a genuine one-of-one print, not three copies of
// anything) sitting next to three real physical copies of a promo that all
// shared one number. Merging by name alone would have collapsed the
// serialized ones together too, which is wrong — a different Number on an
// otherwise-identical-looking card usually means a genuinely different
// print, not a duplicate. A row with no Number captured at all is left
// alone rather than merged on name alone, same "don't guess when getting
// it wrong is worse than doing nothing" discipline as everywhere else in
// this file — Number is frequently left blank by the scan (small, blurry
// text), and guessing two blank-Number rows are duplicates risks silently
// losing a real second copy of a genuinely different print.
