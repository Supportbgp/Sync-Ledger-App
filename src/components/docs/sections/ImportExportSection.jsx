      <h3>Importing a spreadsheet</h3>
      <p>
        Drag a .csv/.xlsx file onto the drop zone, or click to choose one.
        If the file has multiple sheets, you'll pick which one to load
        first. In an .xlsx file specifically, hyperlinks in cells are
        detected and offered as image/source links automatically — a plain
        .csv can't carry that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next is the <strong>column mapping</strong> step: for each field
        Ledger understands (Name, Set, Game, Condition, Price, Rarity,
        etc.), pick which column in your file it corresponds to, or leave
        it "— skip —". Ledger guesses obvious matches automatically from
        your file's own header row. You also pick a Binder/case/collection
        for the whole batch (or map a per-row location column instead), and
        the same Channels checkboxes as the Edit modal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Import mode</strong> matters: <strong>Merge</strong> updates
        matching SKUs and adds anything new, leaving the rest of the catalog
        untouched. <strong>Replace</strong> wipes the entire catalog first —
        only use it if you actually mean to start over.
      </p>
      <DocsCallout kind="note">
        Rows with no image already found get one searched automatically in
        the background — there's no review step here (unlike the Scanner),
        so double-check a few afterward in Catalog if the source names were
        unusual.
      </DocsCallout>

      <h3>Exporting</h3>
      <p>
        Pick a format — Full catalog, a TCG Player entry list, a Collectr
        entry list, Pending POS updates, or Sync history — and optionally
        scope it to one binder/case instead of everything.
      </p>
      <DocsCallout kind="warn">
        Neither TCG Player nor Collectr support Ledger uploading listings to
        them directly. These exports are reference lists to speed up manual
        entry on those platforms, not an automatic sync.
      </DocsCallout>

      <h3>Binder QR codes</h3>
      <p>
        Pick a binder/case and hit Generate — you get a printable QR code
        and a link to a public, login-free page listing everything
        currently in stock in that binder (see{' '}
        <a href="#public-binder-page">The public binder page</a>). It's a
        live lookup, not a one-time snapshot — print it once and stick it on
        the physical binder; it stays accurate as stock changes.
      </p>

      <h3>Reset all data</h3>
      <DocsCallout kind="warn">
        This wipes the entire catalog and sync queue for <em>everyone</em>{' '}
        sharing this Ledger login — not just your own session. It asks you
        to type a confirmation password first. There's no undo.
